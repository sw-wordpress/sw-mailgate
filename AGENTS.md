## Automated review follow-up for pull / merge requests

1. After creating a pull request (PR) or merge request (MR), keep the task open and wait five minutes before checking for automated reviews. Inspect review submissions, inline comments and unresolved review threads, bot comments, and review-related check runs for the latest pushed commit.
2. Assess every reported finding against the code. Fix valid findings, run the relevant checks, and push the corrections to the same PR/MR. Document the reasoning for findings that are incorrect or do not apply; do not silently ignore them.
3. After every push of corrections, wait another five minutes and repeat the review check. Continue this cycle until there are no outstanding valid automated-review findings for the latest commit.
4. If an automated review is still queued or running, keep monitoring and recheck after another five minutes. If review results cannot be accessed or the review fails to run, report that blocker instead of claiming review success.
5. Report success only after the follow-up check finds no outstanding valid findings and no automated reviews still pending. Include the PR/MR link and the review outcome. If no automated review appeared after the five-minute wait, explicitly report that no automated review was received rather than implying approval.
